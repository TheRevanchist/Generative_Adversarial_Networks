# GAN

Here we are going to implement various GAN papers. So far, the papers implemented are:

- Ian Goodfellow, Jean Pouget-Abadie, Mehdi Mirza, Bing Xu, David Warde-Farley, Sherjil Ozair, Aaron Courville, Yoshua Bengio: Generative Adversarial Networks. NIPS 2014
	    results given on CIFAR dataset, supports also batch normalization
- Mehdi Mirza, Simon Osindero: Conditional Generative Adversarial Networks. NIPS 2014
	    results given on MNIST (networks are MLP) and CIFAR-10 (networks are convolutional based)
- Alec Radford, Luke Metz, Soumith Chintala: Unsupervised Representation Learning with Deep Convolutional Generative Adversarial Networks. ICLR 2016
	    results given on CIFAR-10 and LSUN Bedrooms.
- Xudong Mao, Qing Li, Haoran Xie, Raymond YK Lau, Zhen Wang, Stephen Paul Smolley: Least squares generative adversarial networks, ICCV 2017	
- Martín Arjovsky, Soumith Chintala, Léon Bottou: Wasserstein Generative Adversarial Networks. ICML 2017
	    results given on CIFAR-10 and LSUN Bedrooms# GAN
